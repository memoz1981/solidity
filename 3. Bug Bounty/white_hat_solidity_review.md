Just some notes from different sources - mostly youtube videos - on the path to becoming white hat solidity smart contracts hacker. 

- Understanding vs Breaking -> different mindsets
- What-if mentality, no assumptions
- When starting a new audit/review -> first 1-2 days come up with a review plan. 
- Tips
	- Where would I make mistake if I developed/programmed this part of the code?
	- Use Visual Aids (whiteboard, diagrams etc.)
	- There are 2 starting strategies: 
		- Start with orchestrator (central component)
		- Start with isolated component (math etc.)
	- Follow the money and user flows
	- Start with low hanging fruit and then switch to more complex stuff. 
- Tips (to be a **consultant**)
	- Soft skills
	- Clear/concise report
	- Patience
	- If you stop learning - you are out of the **GAME**
	- Mental health -> important to manage stress and burnout. 
	- **Agency** (being get the job done/proactive) beats **Intelligence.** 
	- Ethics - important to be aware of the ethical impacts (communication, behavior, technical impact etc.)
- Thinking in bets -> making best guess and sticking to it. 
- When doing an audit -> **UNDERSTAND IT -> THEN BREAK IT**
- **IMPORTANT: Building is harder than breaking** -> just some appreciation to people who built stuff -> and having modest approach. 
- Tools are substantial -> One example if writing a code in Python/C# to simulate specific part of the code. 
- A fully understood **LOW** is better than untested **FIX**
- **IF IT'S NOT TESTED -> IT'S BROKEN**
- AI can be used as brainstorming tool. 
- Try re-writing the part of the code your own way and then compare
- Peak Experiences are like a **WAVE** -> Instead of trying everything pick your right WAVE. 
- **IMPORTANT** -> Most content winners have a brutal record -> imagine the effort it took from zero to there. 
- Think of Assets/Actors/Actions -> and perhaps + DATA
- Another trilogy is SPEC -> DOCS -> CODE. Although spec may be absent for most
- PRESENT vs ABSENT 
	- What is there that shouldn't be 
	- What is not there that should be
- Challenge everything - no assumptions
- **NOTE**: Blackthorn -> group of elite auditors
- **SHERLOCK CEO/OWNER -> 5 STEPS TO BECOME A TOP-LEVEL AUDITOR**
- In general the biggest challenge for solidity -> is the mindset shift. 
	- **STEP 1** - Understand the code deeply
	Select 2 type of protocols (like Uniswap for AMM and Aave for Lending) -> gain a deep learning on both. 
	 **Note:** Having a **Foundry** knowledge is important to write unit tests. 
	 - **STEP 2** - Read the issues for above protocols -> and come up with your own Checklist
	 The checklist is to be used for future audits. A good checklist is likely to help to capture 80-90% of the bugs. Issues -> Patterns -> Categories -> Vulnerability Type
	 - **STEP 3** - Adopting the attacker mindset 
		 - Make vs break mindset
		 - No assumptions
		 - Constantly reading critical bugs
	 - **STEP 4** - Hands On Experience
	 Best to start with easy/medium tasks before going to complex -> Audit contests are best start as you feel part of a group -> and you may follow up full cycle. 
	 - **STEP 5** - Fast-Feedback loop
	 Following questions will help to close the loop and learn on failures
	 a) Why did I miss the issue
	 b) What questions could I have asked? 
	 c) What heuristics/patterns can I extract from this issue? (to be added to the checklist)
	 d) How can the issue be mitigated

**DON'T OPTIMIZE FOR MONEY -> OPTIMIZE FOR LEARNING**
