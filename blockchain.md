Curve

Stablecoin-focused DEX. Complex math, but contributions are valuable.

Chainlink

Oracle network. Repos include Solidity contracts, node services, and developer tooling.

Safe (Gnosis Safe)

Most widely used multisig wallet. Work includes contracts, plugins, and integrations.

Superfluid

Real-time streaming payments. Good for implementing payment logic and protocol extensions.

Foundry

Modern smart contract toolkit. Contribute features, test improvements, and docs.

Hardhat

Very popular development framework. Issues involve debugging tools, compiler plugins, and integrations.

🏆 3. Hackathons (Fastest Way to Get Noticed)
ETHGlobal

The biggest Web3 hackathon network. Offers cash prizes, mentorship, and direct access to hiring teams.

DoraHacks

Host of worldwide hackathons. Popular for blockchain funding rounds and early-stage startup ideas.

🛡️ 4. Bug Bounty / Auditing Platforms (High-paying)
Code4rena

Competitive audits where multiple auditors review protocols. Rewards are split based on findings.

Sherlock

Similar to Code4rena but with a staked model. Very good for learning structured auditing.

Immunefi

Largest bug bounty platform in Crypto. High-severity Solidity bugs can pay $10k–$500k.

Cantina

Professional, curated auditing competitions by Spearbit. High-quality challenges.

💼 5. Web3 Job Boards
RemoteOK

Remote-first roles with many blockchain companies hiring Solidity devs.

CryptoJobsList

One of the most popular blockchain job aggregators.

👨‍🏫 6. Learning Platforms
Buildspace

Project-based Web3 learning. You build real apps end-to-end.

FreeCodeCamp Web3/Solidity

High-quality, big tutorials for beginners to intermediate.

Alchemy University

Free bootcamps that include weekly tasks and projects.

🏗️ 7. What You Can Build to Improve Your Solidity Knowledge

These projects increase skill from intermediate → advanced. All can be done without deep frontend knowledge.

Smart Contract Only (minimal frontend needed):

ERC-20 with custom logic (fees, burn, reflection)

Staking contract (single token or LP)

Vesting contract (team, investors, cliffs)

DAO with voting & proposals

NFT collection with whitelist minting

Auction contract

Crowdfunding contract

Upgradeable contract using UUPS proxies

Timelocked wallet

Escrow contract

Full DApp Projects (learn integration):

Decentralized exchange simulation

Lending/borrowing prototype

On-chain subscription payments

NFT marketplace (simple)

If you build even 3 of these and put them on GitHub → you are already employable.

🧰 8. What Stack Do You Need Besides Solidity?

The traditional stack is:

✔ Solidity
✔ Hardhat or Foundry
✔ JavaScript/TypeScript (for scripts + deployments + tests)
✔ Frontend: React, Next.js, or Vite
✔ Ethers.js or Viem

BUT: You don’t have to learn JS/TS.

Here are alternatives:

🔄 Alternative Stacks Without JS/TS
Option A — Use C# for Smart Contract Interaction

You can keep using C# to interact with Ethereum.

🔧 Nethereum (C# Web3 library)

Lets you call contracts

Deploy contracts

Sign transactions

Generate C# classes from ABI

Build entire backend in .NET

Perfect for .NET developers who don’t want JS.

Option B — Use Python

Brownie (Solidity framework)

ApeWorx

Web3.py

Python is friendly and JS-free.

Option C — Use Pure Solidity + Foundry

Foundry uses no JS at all.

Tests in Solidity

Deploy in Solidity

Scripts in Solidity

This is currently the fastest and cleanest developer experience.

If you dislike JS, Foundry is the way.

🧪 9. Can You Use C# for Smart Contracts?
Yes — and you can go even further:
✔ Option 1: Stratis Blockchain (C# Smart Contracts)

Stratis allows you to write smart contracts in pure C# running on a .NET VM instead of the EVM.

✔ Option 2: Neo Blockchain (C# Smart Contracts)

Neo supports C# smart contract development using the Neo compiler.

✔ Option 3: Write a C# → WASM Smart Contract System

If you want to get creative, you can build:

A custom blockchain or test chain

That accepts smart contracts compiled from C# to WebAssembly

This is extremely advanced and a great portfolio project.

✔ Option 4: Build a DSL or transpiler

Example:
Write a tool that converts a subset of C# into Solidity (very challenging but impressive).

🔥 10. What to Build If You Want to Bring C# into Smart Contracts

Here are real, impressive projects:

1. A C# wrapper for deploying/interacting with contracts

Cleaner than Nethereum.
Make a modern SDK.

2. A C# smart contract analyzer

Static analysis tool for contracts using Roslyn-like architecture.

3. A transpiler: C# → Solidity

Even if limited, huge portfolio value.

4. A WASM chain that uses C# smart contracts

Your own experimental blockchain.

5. A CLI tool for .NET devs building on EVM

Like:
dotnet web3 deploy
dotnet web3 test
dotnet web3 call

🎁 If You Want, I Can Also:

✔ Design a 6-week learning + building roadmap
✔ Tell you exactly which 3 projects to build first
✔ Propose a C# + Solidity full stack you can start now
✔ Help you pick between Foundry, Hardhat, Nethereum, or Python
